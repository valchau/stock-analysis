# stock-analysis

## Overview

This project provides Steve, a good friend from college with information about how to quickly analysis selected stocks in terms of their daily trading volume, daily opening and closing prices and whether or not each chosen stock is worth investing in.

## Analysis 
At first Steve wanted me to show him how automating the stock analysis would work for one stock with the ticker "DQ". That worked and ran quickly.
So then, Steve asked for a program that used 12 stocks he was interested in along with data he had collected for his project using the year 2018 and then generalizing the program to run 2017 as well. Finally after that program ruan and gave him the desired results I though about program efficiency and I know from learning about Big_) notation that a program with two loops might not run as fast as a program with one loop. In addition, creating one variable to hold data in a loop and continually refreshing the value of that one variable might be less efficient than creating arrays to hold the 12 stock values relating to prices and volume traded. I realize that arrays do have a limitation and therefore to generalize this program for more than 12 stocks will take a different kind of data structure.

## Results
In Conclusion, the image showing theater outcomes by launch date suggests that kickstarter fundraising campaigns launched in May are the most likely to be successful plus the summer months are the next best to time launch. December appears to be the least likely month to be successful so don't expect to start your fundraising campaign in December or in March.  

Looking at the succcess of fundraising campaigns based on the fundraising goals set, the data shows that very small campaigns such as those raising less than $1,000 appear to second most likely to succeed. Raising $1,000  to just under $5,000 dollars are most likely to succeed overall. For some reason, campaigns raising from $15,000 to about $33,000 and from $44,000 or so and above appear fail more than succeed. 

It would be good to find out more about the reasons for failure or success, and know how close to the goal the failing campaigns were. That might help Louise determine when to launch and what goals to set.
